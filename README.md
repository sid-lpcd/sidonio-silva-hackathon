## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a hackathon with the goal of creating an interactive and engaging web application for managing a volleyball league. It offers features such as team selection, league simulation, and dynamic game outcomes based on team stats. The app leverages custom data structures and JavaScript to run simulations and display results, all wrapped in a responsive, user-friendly interface.
